## Overview
This project implements intelligent Pac-Man agents that use sensor-based tracking to locate and eat invisible ghosts. Inspired by the legend of Grandpac, these agents evolve from detecting single stationary ghosts to efficiently hunting multiple moving ghosts.

## Key Implementations
• Sensor-Based Ghost Tracking – Pac-Man relies on sensor data (banging and clanging sounds) to detect hidden ghosts.

• Single Ghost Localization – Implements algorithms to track and eliminate a stationary ghost.

• Multi-Ghost Hunting – Enhances Pac-Man’s abilities to pursue multiple moving ghosts with strategic efficiency.

• Advanced Search & Tracking Strategies – Optimizes Pac-Man’s pathfinding to hunt ghosts more effectively.

## Overview
This project developed a Pacman agent capable of navigating a maze efficiently. The agent will use pathfinding algorithms to reach specific locations and collect food optimally.

## Key Objectives
• Implement pathfinding algorithms to navigate Pacman through the maze.
• Develop strategies to efficiently collect food while avoiding obstacles.
• Gain hands-on experience with search algorithms such as BFS, DFS, A*, and more.

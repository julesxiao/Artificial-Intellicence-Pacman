## Overview
This project implements value iteration and Q-learning to develop intelligent agents capable of decision-making in dynamic environments.

## Key Implementations
• Value Iteration – Computes optimal policies using Bellman equations, allowing agents to make informed decisions.

• Q-Learning – Implements model-free reinforcement learning, enabling agents to learn optimal strategies through trial and error.

• Gridworld Simulation – Tests the agent’s learning process in a controlled environment inspired by classroom examples.

• Crawler Robot Controller – Applies reinforcement learning to a simulated robot controller, improving its movement strategy.

• Pacman Reinforcement Learning – Adapts the learned policies to help Pacman navigate and optimize gameplay.

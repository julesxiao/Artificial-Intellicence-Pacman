## Overview
This project implements AI agents for the classic Pacman game, including both Pacman and ghost behaviors.

## Key Implementations
• Minimax Search Algorithm – Enables Pacman to make optimal decisions by considering all possible moves and their outcomes.

• Expectimax Search Algorithm – Introduces randomness, allowing Pacman to handle uncertain scenarios, such as ghosts moving unpredictably.

• Evaluation Function Design – Improves Pacman’s strategy by assessing game states and making smarter choices.

This project implements core AI methodologies such as:
• Informed state-space search – Exploring optimal decision-making strategies.

• Probabilistic inference – Using uncertainty to make intelligent predictions.

• Reinforcement learning – Training agents to learn from experience.

These concepts have broad real-world applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
